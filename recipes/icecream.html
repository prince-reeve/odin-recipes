        Ice cream is a frozen dessert made from cream, milk, and sugar, often with added flavors and mix-ins such as fruit, nuts, chocolate, and candy. It is typically churned to create a creamy and smooth texture, and can be served in a cone, cup, or dish. Ice cream has a long history, with variations of the treat dating back to ancient China, Greece, and Rome. Today, ice cream is a popular dessert around the world and can be found in many different forms, from soft serve to hand-crafted artisanal varieties.

    <h2>instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the cream, milk, sugar, and salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is hot.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks together. Slowly pour some of the hot cream mixture into the egg yolks while whisking constantly to temper the eggs.</li>
        <li>Pour the egg yolk mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining cream mixture and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl to remove any cooked egg bits.</li> 
        <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, making sure the plastic wrap is touching the surface of the mixture to prevent a skin from forming.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate the mixture for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li> 
        <li>Once chilled, churn the mixture in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
        <li>Transfer the churned ice cream to a container and freeze for at least 4 hours or until firm.</li>
        <li> Scoop and serve the homemade vanilla ice cream as desired.</li>
