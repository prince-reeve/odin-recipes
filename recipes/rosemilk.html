    <p>
        Rose milk, also known as "gulab jamun milk" or "gulab jamun ki kulfi", is a traditional Indian sweet beverage made by mixing rose syrup and milk. The syrup is made by boiling sugar, water and rose petals to create a thick sweet syrup. The syrup is then mixed with milk to create the drink. The drink is often flavored with cardamom powder and saffron. Some variations also include the addition of nuts like pistachios and almonds. The drink is often served chilled, making it a perfect summer refreshment. It is popular in South Asian countries like India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Rose milk is also a popular flavor of ice cream, kulfi and other desserts.
